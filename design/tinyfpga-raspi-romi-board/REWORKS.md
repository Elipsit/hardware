# Reworks

* U1 silk is hard to understand. Doesn't _clearly_ indicate pin 1 / orientation.
* U1 address pins should probably get some thermal relief
* I don't like the copper neck under F1
* While pin 1 is defined on board silk for A1, the A1 module doesn't indicate pin 1 very obviously
* I don't like the closeness of the A1 pins. Makes soldering pretty tricky when trying to avoid shorts
* Silk on power select is switched in a very big way
* transistors suck to solder
* pulldowns on PWM signals are missing
* something about TX and RX is switched 
* the male 1x14 pins I bought are too long
